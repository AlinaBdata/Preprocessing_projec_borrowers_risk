This is my first project as part of the Yandex100 program.

2. Project HTML

#### Project description: 
The project is to prepare a report for a bank’s loan division. We'll need to find out if a customer’s marital status and number of children has an impact on whether they will default on a loan. The bank already has some data on customers’ credit worthiness.

The report will be considered when building the credit scoring of a potential customer. The credit scoring is used to evaluate the ability of a potential borrower to repay their loan.

The project includes processing missing values and duplicates, categorizing data (using nltk library)and some basic analysis.
